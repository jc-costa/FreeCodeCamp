Identify the main section of this page by adding a <main> opening tag before the h1 element, and a </main> closing tag after the p element.-->
        <main>
         <!--Only use one h1 element per page and place lower importance headings below higher importance headings.-->
        <h1>CatPhotoApp</h1>
        <h2>Cat Photos</h2>
        <!--The p element is used to create a paragraph of text on websites. Create a p element below your h2 element and give it the following text:-->
        <!--TODO: Add link to cat photos-->
        <p>See more cat photos in our gallery.</p>
        <!--In the previous step, you put the h1, h2, comment, and p elements inside the main element. This is called nesting. Nested elements should be placed two spaces further to the right of the element they are nested in. This spacing is called indentation and it is used to make HTML easier to read.-->
